Summary: This project applies an evolutionary algorithm to evolve a neural network to analyze and predict outcomes to NBA games.
All the files in the project were written in Python 2.7

NeuralNetwork.py contains the classes for the NeuralNetwork data structure, including definitions for the Neuron, Layer, and Network instances.
ScrapeAndInit.py contains a script to scrape the contents of Basketball-Reference.com for use in the algorithm.

Missing parts: 
-Evolutionary algorithm body, including fitness function that simulates an entire season
-Class definitions for Games and Teams used to store NBA season data
